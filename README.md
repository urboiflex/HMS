"# HMS" 
This is my one of the final assignment project on my university which uses C languages. The purpose of this system is to help admins, doctor, and nurse tracking their inventory management such as room booking, patient medicine list, medicine inventory, paying system, etc. Remember it is just a simple project that built and should be run on terminal :)
